# Serendipy

Hello, everyone. Welcome to the Serendipy database implemtation, this repository is used as a Git submodule and connects to any of our services that may need direct access to our database; such as our [API (Application Programming Interface)](https://github.com/sparkyflight/Potsypaw). This version of Serendipy is fully functional, and stable. We recommend using PostgreSQL 16 for this, however it should function well with versions 14 and up.

Thank you for improving the Sparkyflight experience!
